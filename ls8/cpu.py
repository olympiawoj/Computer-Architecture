'''
RAM - an array of zeros and 1s
-  big array of bytes that can be retrieved by index, just like a regular array.
- 1 byte = 8 bits = 256 possible decimal values 

1 byte =8 bits

Each bit can contain either 0 or 1 so we have 2 possibilities for each bit and 2^8 =256 possibilities for 8 bits and the numbers are from 0 to 255 .

- Use hex (0 to FF) to represent large binary numbers 
- Assuming there are eight bits in one byte (and historically, that hasnâ€™t always been the case), then the number of unique values you can represent using one eight-bit byte is 2828 or 256. The values in decimal range from 0 through 255 (i.e., the bit patterns ranging from 00000000 through 11111111).

Register- baked into hardware, very fast, but small and can only hold 1 word
Word-

LDI - load 'immediate', store a value in a register or 'set this register this value' 
PRN - a psuedo-instruction that prints the nuemric value stored in a register
HLT - halt the CPU and exit the emulator
